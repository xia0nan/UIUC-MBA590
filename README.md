## Assignment 1: Group Video Pitch Presentation Link ( 35 points total)

By the end of **Week 1 — Tuesday, March 14 at 11:59 PM US Central Time**, each group (this is a
team assignment) will be submitting a link to their video presentation pitching the idea/s in your

initiatives to the company's top management team. Here is a summary of useful tips for pitching an
idea: https://www.scienceofpeople.com/how-to-pitch-ideas/
Format: For this video presentation, each group will create a video recording (no voice-over slides)
to pitch their Growth Plan initiative/s to the company's top management team. There is freedom in
terms of the format of the presentation. For example, you may choose a subset of team members to
present your pitch, or all your team members can be part of the video recording. For planning
purposes, the video presentation should be 7 minutes (max.)
Content: The expectation is that each group has made substantial progress in the research about
their (chosen) company and can communicate key selling points of their proposed (non-incremental)
growth initiative/s. Please keep in mind we are asking for recommendations to help address a growth
gap of 4% (per year) in revenue for your (chosen) company.
Each group's presentation will be peer-reviewed by at least two students from different groups in the
course. This assignment will be submitted on Peerceptiv.

## Assignment 3: Growth Plan ( 44 points total)

By the end of **Week 2 — Tuesday, March 21, at 11:59 PM US Central Time**, each group (this is a
team assignment) will be submitting the (complete) written report of your Growth Plan. Submit the
finished document of your Growth Plan, addressing each part and questions from the Growth Plan
Template. This assignment is submitted on Canvas.

## Assignment 4: Teammate Evaluation ( 1 point total)

By the end of **Week 2 — Tuesday, March 21, at 11:59 PM US Central Time**, each student
(individual assignment) will be rating their teammates in their group using the teammate evaluation
survey in Peerceptiv. As you have participated in a team-based project in this course, the purpose of
the teammate evaluation is to assess the extent to which each team member engages and contributes
to the team-based assignment. Submitting your team evaluation carries a one-point total in your
Capstone grade. Everyone will receive a teammate evaluation rating, which is averaged from all the
ratings from your team members on a scale of 1 to 5 on six evaluation categories (Professionalism,
Work Ethic, Participation, Contribution, Preparedness, and Communication). Therefore, you will need
to receive at least a rate of 2.5 points not to get penalized in your group assignments' final score. For
more information about how the rating from teammate evaluation affects your group assignment's
final score, please refer to the "Teammate Evaluation Information" page on Canvas, in Module 0.
