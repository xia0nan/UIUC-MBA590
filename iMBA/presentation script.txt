Our recommendation is for Coursera to expand its offerings to include K-12 education.

Here, we can see that although the competitor Chegg is generating similar revenue to Coursera, it is making a significant profit instead of experiencing a loss. This highlights the potential profitability of entering the K-12 education market for Coursera.

The 2021 market size for K-12 education is estimated to be around 100 billion, and assuming that the online part represents 10% of this total, it is worth around 10 billion. If Coursera can capture just 2% of this target market, it could generate around 200 million in profit, which represents a growth of approximately 40%.

With its established branding, Coursera has the potential to expand into the K-12 education market, which is an opportunity size of around 200 million. This move could benefit Coursera by providing access to a much larger customer base, as young people at this stage typically prioritize education.

Additionally, leveraging their existing technology could significantly lower costs compared to offline K-12 education.

However, it's important to note that there are already established players in the market such as Khan Academy or Duolingo. Moreover, competing in terms of quality with offline competitors like VIPKIDS or New Oriental could be challenging, particularly considering the rise of online products since the pandemic.
